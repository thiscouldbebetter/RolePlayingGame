Scrollable Tile Map Engine
==========================

The code in this repository implements a simple scrolling tile engine for a video game in JavaScript.  It was originally meant to be a first step towards implementing an "overworld" for an old-fashioned RPG.

To see it in action, open the file _Program.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.  The arrow keys move around, and the Enter key can be pressed to use "portals" between different area.
