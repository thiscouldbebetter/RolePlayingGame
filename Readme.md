RolePlayingGame
===============

The code in this repository partially implements a simple console-style role playing video game in JavaScript.  It includes a scrolling tile engine for the "overworld".

To see it in action, open the file RolePlayingGame.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.  The arrow keys move around, and the Enter key can be pressed to use "portals" between different areas.
